# Wheather app

This is a small application that shows us the time in any location in the world, how can we know the time and climate of the whole world?
<a href="https://openweathermap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">openweather API</a> provides us with the data and we only consume it to show it to you

It is a SPA since everything is generated dynamically with javascript, that is to say that nothing is "modeled" itself, how can I see this app?
Well you can clone this repository on your pc and run a local server
